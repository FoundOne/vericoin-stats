If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n\t * following are equivalent:\n\t *\n\t *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n\t *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n\t *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n\t *\n\t * @func\n\t * @memberOf R\n\t * @since v0.5.0\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n\t * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n\t * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n\t * @see R.curry\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n\t *\n\t *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n\t *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n\t *      var g = f(3);\n\t *      g(4); //=> 10\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n\t  if (length === 1) {\n\t    return _curry1(fn);\n\t  }\n\t  return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n\t});\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 12 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\t/**\n\t * Copyright (c) 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n\t * All rights reserved.\n\t *\n\t * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n\t * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
